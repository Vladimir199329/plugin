== Installation ==

NOTE: Before the installation, please check the version of your WooCommerce plugin. You can find it in your Wordpress admin panel in Plugins > Installed plugins. If it’s 3.0.0 or higher, you’re good to go.

You can install Smart WooCommerce Search by Searchanise in 3 ways - two simple ways and the advanced one.

**Through Wordpress plugin search**
It’s the easiest way. All you need to do is:
1. Log in to Wordpress admin panel.
2. Go to Plugins > Add new and enter "Searchanise" into the search bar on the right.
3. Click Install now and wait a couple of seconds for the plugin to install.
4. Click Activate and the indexation of your store will start.
5. Searchanise is installed and you can go play with its settings. The control panel can be found at Products > Searchanise.

**Through Wordpress admin plugin upload**
This one is pretty simple too. Just do the following:
1. Download the plugin zip archive by clicking the blue **Download** button above.
2. Log in to your Wordpress admin panel.
3. Go to Plugins > Add new and click Upload plugin at the top.
4. Browse and select the "smart-search-for-woocommerce.zip" archive you have downloaded earlier.
5. Click Install now and wait a second.
6. Click Activate plugin as the installation is done. Indexation of your store has started.
7. Now you can go to Products > Searchanise to start setting up the plugin you installed so easily.

**Manually through FTP/SFTP**
This method is a bit harder than the previous two. You may need it in case your provider has file restrictions that could prevent you from installing a plugin from the admin area. This is what you should do:
1. Download the plugin zip archive by clicking the blue **Download** button above.
2. Extract the archive to your computer. You’ll get a folder named "smart-search-for-woocommerce" with a bunch of files in it.
3. Open the FTP client on your computer and access your website with FTP/SFTP credentials. If you don’t have any, contact your hosting provider to obtain them.
4. Go to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your website and upload the folder you extracted at step 3 there.
5. Log in to your Wordpress admin panel.
6. Go to Plugins > Installed plugins and find Smart WooCommerce Search by Searchanise. It’s already there!
7. Activate the plugin and the indexation starts.
8. Now go to Products > Searchanise and start setting your new plugin up.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a free trial? =


Sure! You’re welcome to try all the Searchanise Pro features for 14 days. No credit card needed.


= Does Searchanise collect my private data? =


Absolutely not. Searchanise collects only public data: product and category descriptions, prices, and page content. The only private thing we know about you is your email. Credit card payments are processed by PayPal or BlueSnap, secure payment gateways, so we never even see your credit card number.


= How do I subscribe? =


You can pay with a credit card or PayPal. Follow these simple [instructions](https://help.searchanise.com/support/solutions) from our Support portal.


= Can I pay for a full year ahead or make a one-time payment? =


Yes, you can subscribe for Searchanise PRO yearly with 30% discount! Important note: yearly subscriptions can’t be refunded.


= I have a problem! Where can I get help? =


We’ve collected solutions for some common issues in our [Knowledge Base](https://help.searchanise.com/support/solutions). If the answer’s not there, use the Feedback form in your Smart Search by Searchanise control panel to reach our support team. 


In urgent situations, mention @searchanise on Twitter to speed up the investigation.


= Can you add this one really useful feature? =


We’ll be happy to! Please share your ideas on the [Searchanise support portal](https://help.searchanise.com/support/discussions/forums/1000228061). 


= Store products are not submitted to Searchanise for a long period of time, the search engine shows the status ‘No data imported’. =

Check the cron settings of your store. You either do not have periodic cron jobs running at all, or cron schedule is too sparse.

= There is something wrong with timestamps: the Last sync timestamp shown in the admin panel widget does not correspond to the real sync time. =

Make sure you have the correct timezone set in Wordpress. Otherwise, Searchanise falls back to the default timezone which is UTC.


= Is the search supposed to replace the whole search module? =


Searchanise replaces the built-in search and processes all search queries remotely. If, for some reason, Searchanise is not ready to process search requests (e.g. indexing in progress,) the default search is temporarily used. If Searchanise Smart Search does not work in your store, please contact us, we will investigate the case.
